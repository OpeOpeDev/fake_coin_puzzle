# Counterfeit Coin Puzzle: A Generalized Solution for Any Number of Coins!
## The Problem:
You have **N** coins, one of which is counterfeit. The counterfeit coin differs in weight from the others, but you don’t know whether it’s heavier or lighter. Armed with a balance scale, you can perform **M** weighings.
**Can you determine which coin is the counterfeit?**

## Background:
While the classic version of this puzzle is well-known for **N = 12** and **M = 3**, the solution can be extended to any number of coins. However, the generalized solution remains elusive in many resources, including ChatGPT. This post aims to share a definitive solution, complete with Python code to demonstrate the process.

## Solution Overview:
The key is to find the maximum number of coins **N** for which you can identify the counterfeit with **M** weighings. The answer to this puzzle is that you can find the counterfeit coin only if **N ≤ (3^M - 1) / 2**.

## Complete Solution:
To fully solve this problem, two theorems must be proven:

### Theorem 1:
**You can find the counterfeit coin if N is less than or equal to (3^M - 1) / 2.**

### Theorem 2:
**There is no perfect strategy to find the counterfeit coin if N exceeds (3^M - 1) / 2.**

### Proof Outline:
- **Theorem 1:** The proof is intentionally withheld to avoid spoilers, but you can analyze the Python code provided here to uncover the solution.

- **Theorem 2:** Similar to Theorem 1, this theorem can be proven using induction.

## Python Code:
The Python code allows you to input the number of coins **n**. It generates a random list of coin weights, with one coin being either heavier or lighter, and guides you step-by-step through the process of identifying the counterfeit coin.
